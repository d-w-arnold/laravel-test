The biggest difficultly was working not having the reassurance of testing or knowledge to know
whether something I was coding was correct, so when in a successive task we're asked to build on what we've just created,
it can cause a domino effect of problems.

Task 6-10: A lot of my solutions don't work as expected;
I just gave it my best shot having looked over the following docs for assistance:

https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/eloquent-relationships#eager-loading
https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/blade#displaying-data
https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/responses#creating-responses
https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/requests
https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/routing#redirect-routes
https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/http-tests#testing-views
https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/testing

Task 6: Had a HTTP 500 error coming up when trying to run `php artisan serve`,
as my `.env` file needed more environment variable set - I spent a lot of time checking my project/database config
and I eventually resorted to asking for assistance.

Task 7: Attempted this by creating a new migration for a new table 'questionnaire_slug',
and added a new route for when loading based on a provide slug.

Task 8: Not sure if I have done enough in the 'QuestionnaireController',
with more time would've been interested to have created the front-end in either React or Vue.

Task 9: Wasn't sure if the new model 'Responses' needed any methods to define
relationships with other models?

Task 10: Not sure how thorough the testing needed to be for this task?
